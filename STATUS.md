### Phase 02 correctness-closure pass (2026-10-02)

- **SPA toolbar URL synchronization: FIXED** — the embedded Preview
  toolbar previously kept the last full-document URL through client-side
  navigation. Root cause: `PreviewState.url` was only updated by the
  page-load hook and explicit create/navigate commands; same-document
  history changes emit no page-load event, so the snapshot went stale
  while the page itself navigated correctly. Fix: `preview_create`
  subscribes to the child WebView2's native `SourceChanged` and
  `HistoryChanged` events (`webview2-com` via `Webview::with_webview` →
  `ICoreWebView2Controller::CoreWebView2`); each event re-reads the
  control's own `Source` property and writes it through the existing
  generation-guarded `transition`, so page-supplied URLs are never
  trusted and an older event can never overwrite a newer location.
  No IPC privilege was granted to the preview and the loopback
  navigation policy is unchanged.
- **Strict URL regression coverage** — the previous non-fatal tolerance
  in `installed-golden-next.mjs` is replaced by `expectToolbarUrl`
  assertions requiring the toolbar input to equal the preview's real
  location. Covered on the installed build: initial URL, Next App
  Router client navigation, `pushState`, `replaceState`,
  `history.back`/`forward`, hash changes, rapid A→B→C plus rapid
  back×2/forward×2 convergence, the toolbar's own Back/Forward buttons,
  typed toolbar navigation, reload, and inspect + source mapping on the
  SPA destination. The React+Vite golden drives the fixture's own
  pushState link and verifies inspect, Quick Edit and HMR on the
  destination route; the ClientFlow verifier checks history navigation
  on the real project.
- **Re-verified on the new artifact** — installed golden paths
  (React+Vite, Next.js, static, pnpm monorepo), ClientFlow CRM
  (exact `label[for="email"]` → `src/components/ui/label.tsx:9:5`),
  layout/transitions with native Change Project, brand/icons,
  recovery and generic-DOM (Neon Survivor) all PASS; preview IPC
  denial unchanged; CodeMirror still paints syntax-highlighted source
  (refreshed `docs/media` captures). Toolbar layout verified at
  1600×1000, 1366×768 and the 820×560 minimum — no overflow, controls
  reachable, long URLs scroll inside the URL field.
- **Final candidate artifact:** `RootRay_0.3.0_x64-setup.exe` —
  **4,198,122 bytes**, SHA-256
  `3B3ABA817D4EEA8EAE24154B7CFECECF38708B499C1E0BEE24F1BDA578673404`;
  silent install → full installed matrix → verified.
- **CI:** run `36937786536` — `completed / success` on the final
  closure-pass product+test+docs SHA `0eccbd9` (lint, typecheck,
  Vitest, full Playwright E2E, Rust tests/checks, production build all
  green).

### Phase 02 corrective pass (2026-10-02)

A full product QA/repair pass against the installed artifact surfaced and
fixed real defects:

- **Installed CodeMirror rendered blank** — a genuine installed-only
  defect. Tauri injects per-asset `'nonce-…'` sources into the CSP
  `style-src`, which makes the configured `'unsafe-inline'` inert, so
  `style-mod`'s runtime `<style>` (base layout, gutters, theme,
  highlight) was blocked: `.cm-scroller` lost `display:flex;
  overflow:auto`, the content column stacked ~1,100px below the visible
  pane, and line numbers painted over empty space.
  `dangerousDisableAssetCspModification: ["style-src"]` restores the
  declared policy; `script-src` keeps Tauri's nonce hardening. Verified
  by live geometry probe and OS-level screenshot — the editor now paints
  syntax-highlighted source in the installed build.
- **Auto-hidden pane toggle destroyed the saved preference** — clicking
  an Explorer/Inspector toggle while the responsive policy had hidden it
  flipped the persisted preference with no visible effect. The toggle
  now posts an explanatory notice and preserves the preference.
- **Acceptance harness hardening** — e2e servers are killed by process
  tree (Windows shell wrappers previously orphaned `vite preview` and
  poisoned ports); suite preflights fail fast on squatted ports; the
  Playwright global timeout was raised to 30 min for the real-dev-server
  suite; installed verifiers reset persisted WebView2 layout prefs,
  resize the native window to a realistic width, accept the real
  ClientFlow path, drop the Python/Pillow dependency, and wait for the
  inspector bridge to report `inspecting === false` before driving
  Interact clicks; the native folder picker types the target path
  directly (the breadcrumb read raced `NO_CURRENTPATH` when the dialog
  opened on a shell library).
- **Re-verified on the fixed artifact** — installed golden paths
  (React+Vite, Next.js, static, pnpm monorepo), ClientFlow CRM end-to-end,
  layout/transitions incl. native Change Project, brand/icons, and
  invalid-project/missing-deps recovery all PASS; full Playwright suite
  **68 passed** on the final code.
- **Artifact (superseded by the correctness-closure pass above):**
  `RootRay_0.3.0_x64-setup.exe` — **4,190,912 bytes**, SHA-256
  `83E60E3FC1536BF119EF7A9D65F7376DCCD0D96BA7240097A5534649119AE0F9`;
  silent install → launch → verified → clean teardown.
- **CI:** run `36930865061` — `completed / success` on the corrective-pass
  product commit (lint, typecheck, Vitest, full Playwright E2E, Rust
  tests/checks, production build all green).

### Phase 02 final acceptance (2026-10-01)

- **ClientFlow-CRM real installed acceptance:** PASS. Dependencies were
  prepared from its declared `package-lock.json` via `npm ci` plus its
  declared `db:generate` script (generated Prisma client only — no source
  edits). Installed RootRay: analyze (`Next.js 16.2.12`) → Run → embedded
  Preview on `/login` → Preview IPC denial verified → Interact focused
  the real email input → Inspect mapped page, `Card`, `CardHeader`,
  `Label`, form and input with actual non-whitespace CodeMirror source
  and exact marked lines. Exact regression: `label[for="email"]` →
  `src/components/ui/label.tsx:9:5`, component `Label`. Same-file
  refocus (Card → CardHeader at distinct authored lines) and rapid
  Card → input selection (newest wins in Inspector and CodeMirror) both
  PASS. Stop tore down Preview and the dev-server tree; ClientFlow's
  Git state remained identical to its pre-test baseline.
- **Installed core workflow (React + Vite):** PASS — launch → Home →
  Open Project → Ready → Run → embedded Preview → Interact ↔ Inspect →
  source → Quick Edit save → Vite HMR → re-inspect → navigation →
  Stop → Preview teardown → dead URL → no child process tree.
- **Installed static workflow:** PASS — built-in loopback static server,
  authored `<canvas>` → `index.html` mapping, runtime-created element
  honestly reports no source, Quick Edit save, SSE reload, Escape exits
  Inspect, Stop tears down the server.
- **Installed workbench:** PASS — Reset Layout, Explorer/Inspector
  hide/show, Output collapse + resize, Preview Focus, Code Focus,
  Preview/Code split resize, Inspect while Inspector hidden, selection
  and source persistence, Restart, Stop. The native Change Project
  folder-picker continuation now passes: the picker helper types the
  target path into the dialog's filename box (the previous breadcrumb
  read raced `NO_CURRENTPATH` when the dialog opened on a shell
  library).
- **Error / recovery acceptance:** PASS — malformed JSX produces Vite's
  error surface while RootRay stays running, restoring valid source
  recovers; invalid restored project path returns Home with a precise
  readable-directory/system-not-found notice; missing Next dependency
  reaches a visible failed state with the concrete npm/cmd
  command-not-found output, enabled Retry, no stuck Preview and no
  surviving child process.
- **Version consistency:** `0.3.0` across root `package.json`, all eight
  `packages/*` manifests, `apps/desktop/package.json`,
  `tauri.conf.json` and both `Cargo.toml` manifests (`@rootray/e2e` is
  intentionally `private`/`0.0.0`).
- **Windows identity:** unchanged — official ICO is bound to the
  executable, installer, uninstaller, Start Menu, taskbar and Alt+Tab
  surfaces; the in-app header has no interior icon. Covered by the
  committed ICO generation/configuration tests.
- **Candidate artifact of that pass (since superseded):**
  `RootRay_0.3.0_x64-setup.exe` — **4,189,851 bytes**, SHA-256
  `0BED4EDFC2907C973ABB2E9B60B8B87BC970876F993CE7C970854C9E36E86AB0`;
  silent install → launch (no auto-run) → terminate → uninstall →
  binary removal PASS under Windows PowerShell.
- **CI:** run `36906354904` — `completed / success` on the Phase 02
  candidate; a follow-up run gates this documentation commit.
- **Remaining blockers:** none. Human acceptance and green CI on the
  exact pushed SHA remain mandatory; v0.3.0 remains unpublished and
  untagged until explicit approval.

### Phase 01 release-candidate closure (2026-10-01)

- **Repository identity:** all active tracked links now use
  `https://github.com/abudoxali/RootRay`; the stale-owner scan returns zero
  matches. Settings/About has focused regression coverage for the canonical
  repository URL.
- **Repository metadata:** the GitHub homepage is
  `https://github.com/abudoxali/RootRay/releases/latest`; description and
  topics were preserved.
- **Documentation synchronization:** README, SECURITY, CHANGELOG, community
  links, release-workflow comments and Tauri product description were checked
  against the current implementation and corrected without expanding scope.
- **Architecture:** `docs/architecture.md` now describes the v0.3 React/Tauri/
  core flow, InspectorAdapter paths, embedded child WebView2 Preview, bounds
  synchronization, IPC isolation, loopback policy, selection transport,
  CodeMirror handoff, safe-save path and responsive workbench behavior.
- **Blank-editor regression:** PASS. The automated workbench acceptance requires
  rendered `.cm-content`/`.cm-line` source and the exact marked line; the
  installed ClientFlow verifier explicitly covers `label[for="email"]` →
  `src/components/ui/label.tsx`, non-whitespace CodeMirror text and exact line
  focus. The implementation was reviewed and required no product-code change.
- **Installed verification:** the exact fresh installer below passed silent
  install, resource checks, launch/no-auto-run and uninstall smoke. Reinstalled
  from the same artifact, the maintained React + Vite fixture passed analyze →
  Run → embedded Preview → Interact/Inspect → source → edit/save → HMR →
  re-inspect → Stop, Preview teardown and owned-process/URL shutdown. Preview
  IPC denial was verified. Official ICO generation/configuration tests passed.
- **ClientFlow-CRM:** the local checkout was found at
  `C:\Users\Abud\Desktop\GitHub\ClientFlow CRM`, but `node_modules/next` was
  absent. The verifier stopped at its dependency precondition, so no new
  ClientFlow runtime result is claimed in this pass.
- **Acceptance harness:** fresh-install settings seeding now creates its config
  directory, and installed workbench checks account for responsive Inspector
  collapse while preserving Preview + Code priority.
- **Known remaining release blockers:** none from the local release gate.
  Human acceptance and successful CI on the exact pushed SHA remain mandatory;
  v0.3.0 remains unpublished and untagged.

### Latest visual correction checks

- Desktop Vitest: **103 passed** (`pnpm --filter @rootray/desktop test`)
- Focused Workbench Playwright: **23 passed**
- Full Playwright regression: **67 passed**
- TypeScript: **PASS** (`pnpm -r typecheck`)
- Biome: **0 errors** (8 existing CSS specificity warnings)
- Desktop production build: **PASS**
- Workspace build: **PASS**
- Tauri/NSIS build: **PASS**
- Installer smoke: **PASS**
- Installed ClientFlow source/density verification: **PASS** — explicit
  `label[for="email"]` resolved to `src/components/ui/label.tsx:9:5`
  with component `Label`; 5 selections (page, Card, Label, form, input)
  rendered actual CodeMirror source with exact line focus and responsive-
  hidden Inspector metadata remained attached and usable when restored.

### Workbench Density + Inspector Responsiveness Pass

- **Blank editor correction:** the previous acceptance was a false
  positive because it checked the source path before lazy CodeMirror had
  mounted; line-number/path presence was incorrectly treated as success.
  The installed DOM diagnostic showed source reads and styles were valid,
  but the editor could transiently expose an unready view. CodeMirror now
  reconciles after view creation and keeps the editor surface hidden until
  its document has non-whitespace source (empty files remain valid).
- **Mandatory DOM regression:** installed acceptance waits for `.cm-content`,
  requires non-whitespace `.cm-line` text, compares rendered text to disk,
  verifies computed contrast/visibility, and verifies the exact marked line
  for page.tsx, card.tsx, label.tsx, and login-form.tsx.
- **Slow mount behavior:** the lazy editor regression shows `Loading
  source…` before CodeMirror readiness and never exposes numbered blank
  code; source text then appears and the loading state disappears.
- **Split priority:** Split preserves Preview + Code first. Preview and
  Code each retain a 360px practical minimum; Explorer and Inspector are
  secondary panes.
- **Responsive pane collapse:** actual workbench width is measured with
  `ResizeObserver`. Inspector auto-collapses before Explorer when Split
  cannot satisfy Preview + Code minimums. Responsive hides are transient
  and never overwrite persisted user visibility preferences; widening
  restores the requested state.
- **Inspector usability:** width is clamped to 300–420px with a 350px
  default. Source metadata uses readable filename, ellipsized path,
  compact confidence badge, and one-line `line:column` coordinates.
- **Inspector deduplication:** the large read-only source snippet was
  removed from Inspector. Source, Component, and Styles & Box Model are
  collapsible metadata sections; the Code pane owns source rendering.
- **Output/Explorer behavior:** Output remains collapsed by default,
  Explorer state remains preserved and independently collapsible, and the
  shell/panes retain internal scrolling without global window scroll.
- **Screen-size verification:** responsive Playwright checks pass at
  **1920×1080**, **1600×900**, and **1366×768**; no pane or toolbar
  overflow was observed.
- **ClientFlow-CRM installed acceptance:** fresh NSIS Run → embedded
  Preview → Inspect → source reveal with actual CodeMirror text and exact
  line focus → Inspector hide/restore → Explorer collapse → Output
  resize/collapse → Preview Focus → Restart/Stop all passed. The native
  Change Project picker continuation remains environment-limited by the
  machine's `git hub`/`GitHub` path alias (`NO_ANCHOR`), not a product
  assertion failure.

### Official App Icon Correction

- `docs/brand/source/official-app-icon.png` is the canonical source for
  the Windows/Tauri application icon.
- The previous application-icon source is superseded; no hand-authored
  robot substitute or ring-only identity is used.
- The in-app header image icon was removed. The RootRay wordmark/name
  and `Point at the UI. Reach the source.` tagline remain.
- Official icon frames were generated at **16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 128,
  and 256px** and assembled into the Tauri/Windows ICO.
- NSIS installer and uninstaller icons are explicitly configured to use
  the generated official ICO.
- Fresh installed verification: executable, title bar, taskbar, Start
  Menu, native big/small window icons (Alt+Tab/title-bar surfaces),
  installer, uninstaller, and Programs & Features all use the official
  icon; the header has no interior image icon.

### Current development installer

- `RootRay_0.3.0_x64-setup.exe` — **4,198,122 bytes**, SHA-256
  `3B3ABA817D4EEA8EAE24154B7CFECECF38708B499C1E0BEE24F1BDA578673404`
  (Phase 02 correctness-closure candidate; supersedes all earlier v0.3
  candidate artifacts, including the 4,190,912-byte corrective-pass
  build `83E60E3F…AE0F9`)

- **Product candidate source identity:** read the final product-code
  commit with `git rev-parse HEAD` after the candidate commit.
- **Product candidate CI:** latest pushed candidate CI is reported with
  the final acceptance result for that exact SHA.
- **Last Updated:** 2026-10-02

### Framework compatibility & capability tiers

- **Evidence-based framework detection** — the `Framework` enum gains
  `VueVite`, `SvelteVite`, `SvelteKit`, `Astro`, `Nuxt`, `Angular` and
  `Remotion`, detected from real manifest dependencies and framework
  config files (never directory names). The TypeScript `Framework` union
  in `packages/shared` mirrors the Rust serialization.
- **Generic Vite adapter reused honestly** — `InspectorAdapter::
  ViteGeneric` now serves `Framework::Vite`, `VueVite` and `SvelteVite`:
  any project whose dev script reconstructs to a plain `vite` invocation
  runs under RootRay's in-memory plugin with `generic-dom` mode. Authored
  `index.html` elements map exactly; framework-rendered DOM reports
  facts + styles with no fabricated source; component intelligence is
  `not-applicable` with a framework-named reason.
- **SvelteKit / Astro / Nuxt / Angular / Remotion = detect & run** —
  these servers render outside Vite's `transformIndexHtml` pipeline
  (SvelteKit sets `appType: "custom"`), so no adapter injects. They are
  detected with versions, run via their declared script, and open the
  printed loopback URL — inspection capabilities report `unavailable`
  with the factual reason instead of a dead-end or a false promise.
- **Authored-bytes stamping guard** — `transformIndexHtml` now stamps
  only when the served HTML is byte-identical to the authored file on
  disk; if anything upstream has already transformed the document,
  stamping is skipped rather than emitting fabricated coordinates.
- **Fixtures** — `fixtures/vue-vite`, `fixtures/svelte-vite` (real deps,
  real e2e through the inspector runner), plus detection-only manifests
  for `sveltekit-basic`, `astro-basic`, `nuxt-basic`, `angular-basic`.
- **`examples/serve.rs`** — a live static-server smoke: starts the real
  loopback server with inspector injection on any directory and reports
  stamping/runtime delivery over real HTTP. Used to validate
  One-Bullet-Arena (real static site): `GET /` 200, authored HTML
  stamped, runtime + bootstrap injected, `runtime.js` served, clean
  shutdown.

### Milestone 03 — Generic Browser Runtime, Static Web & Non-React Inspection

The enduring objective: **RootRay stays useful when the page is not
React.** This milestone delivers framework-free DOM inspection on every
supported runtime, exact authored-HTML source mapping, a native static
server for `index.html` projects, and honest source-less selections for
runtime-created DOM.

- **Source-optional protocol** — `element:selected.source` is now
  optional in `@rootray/source-protocol`, `packages/shared`, and the Rust
  mirror. Validation stays strict whenever a source IS present; a
  runtime-created element reports facts and styles with no fabricated
  location.
- **`@rootray/html-instrument`** — parser-based (parse5 + magic-string)
  HTML stamping: every authored renderable element gets
  `data-rootray-file/line/column` from real parse locations. Structural
  tags (`html/head/body/meta/script/…`) are skipped; template contents
  are traversed; authored `data-rootray-*` is stripped before trusted
  stamps — spoofing can't survive. The Rust mirror
  (`html_instrument.rs`, lol_html) implements the identical contract for
  the static server.
- **Generic DOM runtime mode** — `inspector-runtime` gains
  `mode: "generic-dom" | "jsx-meta"` plus `reloadUrl`. generic-dom picks
  the element itself (every DOM node is inspectable, `<canvas>` included)
  and reports source only when the element itself carries a valid stamp.
  jsx-meta keeps the legacy nearest-instrumented-ancestor contract —
  React/Next behavior is unchanged. The overlay shows "no source" instead
  of hiding. An `EventSource` client on `reloadUrl` reloads the page on
  save-driven notifications.
- **Vite generic path** — `InspectorAdapter::ViteGeneric` for
  `Framework::Vite`; the runner forwards `ROOTRAY_INSPECTOR_MODE`. The
  plugin's `transformIndexHtml` now runs with `order: "pre"` — Vite's
  internal `devHtmlHook` injects `/@vite/client` *before* normal hooks,
  which had silently offset stamped lines by +2 on the first e2e run.
  Stamping raw authored HTML keeps positions factual.
- **Native static server** (`static_server.rs`) — loopback-only HTTP
  for projects with no dev script: traversal/junction/host-header safe,
  GET+HEAD, nested-target subdirectory support, Rust-side HTML
  instrumentation + runtime/bootstrap injection, and an SSE endpoint
  (`/__rootray/events`) that reloads connected pages after RootRay saves.
  AppCore owns its lifecycle; Stop/Restart treat it like any other
  server. Event ordering is fixed so `UrlDetected` reaches the UI with
  the Running state already applied (the installed app previously sat
  at "starting" — a stale state snapshot raced the URL event).
- **Instrumentation idempotency** — `jsx-instrument` now keeps a
  previous pass's stamp when `data-rootray-file` already names the real
  module: bundler chains may run the loader twice, and recomputing on
  transformed code had silently shifted the Next golden path by one line
  (the injected entry import). Mismatched/absent stamps are still
  stripped and restamped.
- **Frontend** — every source-dependent action guards on `sel.source`:
  Open Source / Quick Edit / Copy Path / Copy Context / component
  intelligence / source preview / editor sync. Source-less selections
  show DOM facts and styles and are marked "No authored source".
- **Fixtures** — `fixtures/vite-vanilla` (TS, no framework) and
  `fixtures/nested-static/app` (subdirectory static site).

### Milestone 02 — Next.js Runtime & Visual Source Inspection

- **Inspector adapter abstraction** — `InspectorAdapter::for_framework`
  dispatches per-framework launch/instrumentation: `ViteReact` (unchanged
  runner path) and `NextJs` (new). Unsupported frameworks get honest
  capability states, never a dead-end.
- **`@rootray/jsx-instrument`** — the Babel JSX/TSX stamping logic
  extracted from vite-plugin into a shared package; both adapters use it.
- **`@rootray/next-adapter`** — `next-shim.cjs` is loaded into the
  `next dev` process via `node --require` (argv form — no NODE_OPTIONS
  whitespace issues, scoped to the bundler process). It hooks
  `Module._load` so every importer of `next/dist/server/config.js`
  receives a wrapped `loadConfig` that merges RootRay's loader into
  `turbopack.rules` and wraps `config.webpack` for the `--webpack` path.
  The loader emits directive-aware code (injected entry import lands
  *after* `"use client"`) and a relative import to a session entry written
  under `node_modules/.cache/rootray-<sid>/` — inside the Turbopack root,
  outside volatile `.next/`, removed on session end (stale dirs swept on
  next launch; only `rootray-*` names are ever removed).
- **React 19** — `_debugSource` is gone; `_debugOwner`/`_debugStack`
  exist in dev builds. The runtime treats them as a bounded, failure-
  silent *hint layer* (`fiber.ts`) that can enrich a selection's
  `componentName` when instrumentation did not carry one. Location always
  comes from stamped DOM attributes; `source.confidence` ("exact" |
  "approximate" | "component") is now part of the wire protocol.
- **Coverage proven** — Next 16.3.5 Turbopack: App Router page/layout/
  server+client components, Pages Router `/legacy`, CSS Modules,
  Tailwind v4, repeated siblings (each keeps its own JSX site), client-
  side navigation, hard navigation re-authentication, Fast Refresh after
  Quick Edit save. Next 16 `--webpack` and Next 15.5.12 webpack:
  instrumented render + bridge handshake.
- **Capabilities** — Next.js targets report dom-inspect/style-inspect/
  source-mapping/hmr **available** when the dev script is safely
  reconstructable (`next dev` + plain flags); component-intelligence is
  **partial** (server-component ownership is static). Complex/wrapped
  scripts still run — inspection reports the reason instead.
- **Protocol v1 backward compatibility — PASS**:
  `ROOTRAY_PROTOCOL_VERSION` remains 1. The additive `source.confidence` field
  ("exact" | "approximate" | "component") is backward-compatible. Deterministic
  tests in TypeScript (`@rootray/source-protocol`) and Rust (`rootray-core`)
  prove: (a) old v1 payloads without confidence are accepted, (b) new v1 payloads
  with valid confidence levels are accepted, (c) unknown levels like "guessed"
  and `null` values are rejected, and (d) serialization omits `confidence` when
  absent.
- **Installed-app verification — PASS**:
  - **ClientFlow-CRM (real Next.js 16.2.12 application)**:
    Real installed `rootray-desktop.exe` → auto-analyze → `Next.js 16.2.12 · npm · npm run dev` →
    Run → `http://localhost:3000/` → bridge connected → 4 real authored elements mapped:
    `<h1>` → `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx:41:13` (`LoginPage`),
    `<div>` → `src/components/ui/card.tsx:11:5` (`Card`),
    `<form>` → `src/components/ui/label.tsx:9:5` (`Label`),
    `<input>` → `src/components/auth/login-form.tsx:46:11` (`LoginForm`).
    Style intelligence (box model) rendered for all selections. Stop confirmed via direct
    network probe. ClientFlow's git status remained identical to the pre-test
    baseline; pre-existing repository state was not created or changed by RootRay.
    *Discovered test issue*: `page.goto(appUrl)` was an invalid server-death check on PWA apps because
    ClientFlow's Service Worker (`public/sw.js`) served offline fallback content even after the Next
    server was dead. All installed tests now use direct loopback network probes outside the browser context.
  - **Nested Next Monorepo (`fixtures/pnpm-monorepo`)**:
    Demonstrates `workspaceRoot != activeTargetRoot`. Workspace root = `fixtures/pnpm-monorepo`,
    active target = `fixtures/pnpm-monorepo/apps/web` (cwd = target root).
    Open monorepo root → detected as `pnpm workspace` → `apps/web` active (`pnpm run dev`) →
    Run → URL detected → bridge connected → click `<h1>` in `Banner.tsx` →
    selection reports workspace-relative `apps/web/components/Banner.tsx:4:10` (never `src/...` or absolute `C:\...`).
    Quick Edit opens `apps/web/components/Banner.tsx` without saving.
    Explorer remains rooted at workspace root (`apps/` + `packages/` visible).
    Workspace Search covers entire workspace (finds `apps/api/src/index.js` outside active target;
    opening it verifies security root = workspace root). Stop verified via direct network probe;
    stable entry stubbed; zero scratch dirs left behind.
  - **Next.js Fixture (`tests/e2e/installed-golden-next.mjs`)**: PASS.
  - **React+Vite Fixture (`tests/e2e/installed-golden.mjs`)**: PASS.

### What changed (v0.2.0, Milestone 01)

- **Universal workspace model** — `crates/rootray-core/src/project/workspace/`
  replaces the single-project `supported: bool` analysis with an
  authoritative `WorkspaceAnalysis`: workspace kind, package manager,
  manifests, technologies, targets, capability matrix, findings, warnings
  and real discovery metrics.
- **Three roots kept distinct** — `workspace.root` (selected directory =
  workspace root = filesystem security root), `target.absoluteRoot`
  (nested package the runtime acts on), and the unchanged security
  boundary all filesystem features enforce.
- **Bounded discovery** — depth ≤ 4, ≤ 400 dirs, ≤ 64 manifests, ≤ 256 KB
  metadata; generated dirs (`node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, `build`,
  `.next`, `.turbo`, `target`, `coverage`, `out`, `playwright-report`,
  `test-results`, `.e2e-work`, caches) are never entered; nothing is
  executed; secret files are never read.
- **Capability engine** — per-target `CapabilityMatrix` with
  available / partial / unavailable(+reason) / not-applicable states for
  browse, search, quick-open, quick-edit, safe-write, open-external, run,
  browser-open, dom-inspect, style-inspect, source-mapping,
  component-intelligence and HMR awareness. The global "Unsupported"
  dead-end is gone.
- **Detection** — Next.js (with declared version), React+Vite, Vite
  (non-React), static web (`index.html`), Node web (Express/NestJS…),
  Node CLI tools, libraries; pnpm/npm/yarn workspaces, Turborepo,
  package-manager inheritance, runner candidates (`dev` > `serve` >
  `start`, argv-only `pm run <script>`).
- **Active target** — `set_active_target` Tauri command; a single
  unambiguous web-app target is auto-selected, a `<select>` appears when
  multiple targets exist; run cwd is the target root while Explorer/Search
  stay workspace-rooted.
- **UI** — ProjectView shows workspace kind, target selector, framework +
  version, technology chips, grouped capability rows with reasons, and no
  global dead-end.
- **New error codes** — `WORKSPACE_TARGET_NOT_FOUND`,
  `TARGET_RUNNER_UNAVAILABLE`.

### Deferred to later milestones

- Framework-specific runtime adapters for SvelteKit, Astro, Nuxt,
  Angular, Remotion (they render outside Vite's `transformIndexHtml`;
  each needs its own server-side injection point).
- Component-level intelligence for Vue/Svelte (generic DOM inspection
  already covers every element; component-tree mapping is the gap).

### v0.2.0 verification

- `cargo test -p rootray-core` — 195 passed, 0 failed, 1 ignored
  (`golden_path_real_vite_server` — real `npm run dev` run, passes with
  `--ignored`). Coverage includes `static_server` (14 tests — serving,
  traversal/host-header/junction safety, HTML stamping, SSE reload,
  nested targets, AppCore run/stop, event-ordering contract),
  `html_instrument` units, and the new framework-detection/capability
  matrix + adapter-dispatch cases.
- `pnpm -r test` — Vitest 162 green (shared 7, source-protocol 21,
  intelligence 17, jsx-instrument 20, html-instrument 11, vite-plugin 8,
  inspector-runtime 21, next-adapter 5, desktop 52).
- `pnpm --filter @rootray/e2e test` — Playwright 40 e2e green
  (generic-dom connect/auth, exact authored HTML mapping, source-less
  runtime-DOM selection, canvas mapping + click suppression, Escape-off;
  + Vue+Vite and Svelte+Vite real-server specs: bridge handshake, exact
  authored mapping, honest no-source on framework-rendered DOM).
- `pnpm -r typecheck`, `pnpm exec biome check .`, `cargo check` (both
  crates), `cargo build -p rootray-desktop` — green.
- `pnpm build:tauri` — release build + NSIS bundle green
  (`RootRay_0.2.0_x64-setup.exe`); `scripts/installer-smoke.ps1` — PASS.
- **Installed-app golden paths — ALL PASS** (all drive the real installed
  `rootray-desktop.exe` via WebView2 CDP + a controlled Chromium page with
  direct network probes for server shutdown):
  - `installed-golden-static.mjs` (static-web fixture — native server,
    authored `<canvas>` → `index.html:8:5`, unmapped runtime element,
    Quick Edit → SSE reload, clean stop): PASS
  - `installed-verify-shadow-runner.mjs` (real Vite 6.2.0 + Phaser game —
    authored `#game-container` → `index.html:24:5`, runtime canvas
    honestly unmapped): PASS
  - `installed-verify-clientflow.mjs` (ClientFlow-CRM, Next.js 16.2.12): PASS
  - `installed-golden-monorepo.mjs` (pnpm monorepo nested Next target): PASS
  - `installed-golden-next.mjs` (Next.js fixture): PASS
  - `installed-golden.mjs` (React+Vite fixture): PASS
- Real-repo validation: `ClientFlow-CRM` live shimmed `next dev` renders
  `data-rootray-*` on real SSR output (`/login`, 200) and passes 4-element
  source mapping with style intelligence; `ELHABAK-Construction-System-V1`
  monorepo → 8 targets, `apps/web` Next.js 16.0.3 auto-selected with runtime
  caps available; Shadow Runner runs under the generic Vite adapter with
  honest source-less selection on runtime-created DOM.

### Historical — Full Product Identity + Inspect-to-Code Reliability Pass

(Historical pass — produced the candidate current at that time; the
accepted artifact and gate results now live in **Current Development**
above.)

- **Stable Release Baseline**: v0.2.0 remains immutable and published. v0.3.0 remains UNPUBLISHED and UNTAGGED.
- **Inspect-to-Code Reliability**:
  - **Root Cause Diagnosed**: In `CodeEditor.tsx`, language syntax highlighting extensions load asynchronously. The initial editor build closed over the empty string `""` from when `ed.status === "loading"`. When `build()` completed, it initialized CodeMirror `EditorState` with `doc: ""` and dropped line focus. Rapid selection also lacked monotonic sequence numbers, allowing stale read responses to overwrite newer selections. In `useAutoReveal.ts`, same-file reselection returned early before switching `workspaceTab` to `"split"`.
  - **Pipeline Fix**:
    1. Added monotonic request sequencing `seq` to `EditSession` and reducer actions (`edit-open`, `edit-opened`). Stale read completions with older sequence numbers are discarded.
    2. `EditorPanel.tsx` directly renders `.qe-loading` while `ed.status === "loading"`, mounting `LazyCodeEditor` with `key={ed.relativePath}` only when document text is ready.
    3. `CodeEditor.tsx` tracks document text and focus position with `valueRef` and `focusRef` so `build()` always creates `EditorState` with the actual file text and immediately focuses the inspected line.
    4. `useAutoReveal.ts` no longer returns early on same-file selections, guaranteeing that re-clicking elements in the same file re-centers line focus and switches from `preview` to `split` view.
- **Brand Inspection Overlay**:
  - `packages/inspector-runtime/src/overlay.ts` redesigned to use RootRay glowing orange `#ff6b0c` (`border: 1.5px solid #ff6b0c`, glowing ray box shadow).
  - Dark translucent chip with `backdrop-filter: blur(8px)`.
  - Glowing orange ray indicator dot before component/tag name.
  - High-contrast hierarchy: orange component name (`#ff9d5c`), muted path and line location (`#9aa4b8`).
- **Unified Product Visual Language**:
  - Centralized SVG icon system (`apps/desktop/src/components/icons.tsx`) replacing ad-hoc unicode glyphs (`×`, `⤢`, `◧`, `◨`, `▤`, `⟲`, `←`, `→`, `⟳`, `⌕`, `⧉`, `↗`, `▸`, `⌃`, `⌄`, `⌫`).
  - Dark scrollbars now use the centralized brand border token (`var(--rr-border)`) rather than a hard-coded legacy gray.
  - Clean neutral styling for workbench view tabs (`Preview` | `Code` | `Split`) and `Interact`; glowing RootRay orange badge for active `Inspect`.
  - Inspector confidence badges with high-contrast distinct styles (`EXACT SOURCE`, `APPROXIMATE`, `COMPONENT`, `UNRESOLVED`).
  - Active file row highlighting in Explorer (`background: rgba(255, 107, 12, 0.09)`, `inset 2px 0 var(--accent)`).
  - Error boundary asset updated to canonical `/brand/error.png`.
- **Quality Gates & Verification** (historical pass counts; current counts are
  in **Current Development** above):
  - Rust: **213 passed** / 1 ignored (`cargo test`)
  - Vitest: **204 passed** across all packages (`pnpm -r test`)
  - Playwright E2E: **64 passed**
  - Biome: 0 errors (`pnpm exec biome check .`)
  - TypeScript: 0 errors across 10 workspace projects (`pnpm -r typecheck`)
  - Installer smoke: **PASS** (`scripts/installer-smoke.ps1`)
  - ClientFlow-CRM verification: `login-form.tsx` line 46 verified.

### Historical — Approved Artwork Reconstruction — 2026-09-20

This pass corrects the previous brand implementation that had
reinterpreted RootRay's identity instead of deriving it from the supplied
approved artwork.

- **Previous reinterpretation rejected:** removed the hand-authored
  small robot maps and obsolete previous-pass masters
  (`board.jpg`, `icon-src.png`, `lockup-src.png`, `wordmark-src.png`).
  The orange ring/simple mark is not used as the application icon.
- **Canonical artwork established:** committed the supplied approved
  boards under `docs/brand/source/` and rewrote
  `scripts/build_brand_assets.py` so generated assets are crops/resizes
  from those images, not redraws.
- **Production extraction:** regenerated mascot, wordmark, lockup,
  splash, empty/success/error state art, hero/social preview, runtime
  public brand assets, and Windows icon frames.
- **App icon validation:** final installed verification confirms the
  executable, Start Menu shortcut, title bar and taskbar all contain the
  approved robot icon signature.
- **Home validation:** installed Home uses the approved empty-state
  mascot artwork and the extracted header wordmark/tagline.
- **Header validation:** header uses `mascot-head.png` plus the extracted
  `wordmark.png`; CSS-built Root/Ray wordmark text was removed from the
  prominent header brand.
- **Ready-state layout correction:** analyzed-but-not-running state now
  uses the desktop width as a workspace: Explorer on the left, Ready/run
  action panel in the center, project details/capabilities on the right.
  It no longer collapses into a narrow centered dashboard.
- **README hero correction:** README hero and GitHub social preview
  derive from the supplied wide artwork. README explicitly separates
  brand artwork from real product screenshots.
- **Installed visual acceptance:** final installed build captured Home,
  Ready, Waiting for dev server, Running workbench, Inspect-to-Code
  split, Preview Focus, Settings/About, taskbar, title-bar, Start Menu
  and executable icon verification. Screenshots live under
  `target/installed-verify-brand/`; selected real product screenshots
  were refreshed in `docs/media/`.
- **Fresh installer (historical for this pass):**
  `RootRay_0.3.0_x64-setup.exe` — **4,036,371 bytes**, SHA-256
  `D841E659599C01F48FADC8D9100694A567404E7F5B6CE0699467C27CF2C26350`.
  This artifact was current for that pass and is superseded by the
  Official App Icon Correction installer in **Current Development**.
- **Verification:** `cargo test -p rootray-core` — 213 passed, 1 ignored;
  `cargo test -p rootray-core --test suite -- --ignored` — 1 passed;
  `pnpm -r test` — all workspace tests passed including desktop Vitest
  92, package Vitest suites for 204 Vitest tests total, and Playwright
  64; `pnpm --filter @rootray/e2e test` — 64 passed;
  `pnpm -r typecheck` —
  pass; `pnpm exec biome check .` — pass with 8 existing CSS specificity
  warnings; `cargo check -p rootray-core`, `cargo check -p
  rootray-desktop`, `cargo build -p rootray-desktop`, `pnpm -r build`,
  `pnpm build:tauri` — pass; `scripts/installer-smoke.ps1` — PASS;
  `node tests/e2e/installed-verify-brand.mjs` — PASS on the final
  installed build.

**v0.3.0 remains unpublished and untagged.**

### Historical — Integrated Browser Workbench

**Integrated browser workbench.** The project now runs *inside* RootRay:
Run → the dev-server URL opens in an embedded WebView2 child surface →
normal app interaction → Inspect → click an element → source opens
beside the preview → edit + save → HMR/Fast Refresh applies in place →
stop tears the surface down with the process tree. External browser
opening remains an explicit fallback action, never the default.

#### Architecture (historical)

- **Native child webview** — a second WebView2 (`project-preview`)
  parented to the main window, created via `Window::add_child` (Tauri
  `unstable` feature). The React `.preview-host` div is only a
  measurement rect; a `ResizeObserver`/rAF loop pushes bounds via
  `preview_set_bounds`, and the surface is hidden while modals, palettes
  or pane drags cover its pixels.
- **Privilege isolation** — capabilities scope every privilege to
  `webviews: ["main"]`; the preview gets zero command access (verified
  by an in-page IPC probe — every invoke denied by ACL). All preview
  commands additionally reject non-`main` callers natively.
- **Navigation policy** — main-frame navigation is loopback-only;
  `window.open`/`target=_blank` is denied, local URLs re-navigate the
  preview, remote http(s) goes to the system browser unprivileged.
- **Preview state** — `hidden → waiting → loading → ready → stopped →
  error` with a monotonic generation; `rootray://preview-state` pushes
  snapshots and the reducer drops stale ones (including across dispose).
- **Workbench layout** — Preview/Code/Split tabs; inspect selections
  auto-reveal the mapped source beside the preview; Ctrl+Shift+C and
  Escape toggle Inspect from *inside* the preview (runtime keydown);
  canvas/runtime-created DOM stays honestly source-unresolved.

### Historical — Layout and Lifecycle Pass

- **Resizable, collapsible workbench** — Explorer and Inspector panes
  collapse to the rail (Ctrl+B) and drag-resize; the Output console
  collapses to a bar and drags vertically (Ctrl+J); the preview/code
  split drags over a wide range and double-click resets. Layout state
  (visibility, widths, split ratio, focus mode) persists under
  `rootray.layout.v1` with clamping, and **Reset Layout** in Settings
  restores defaults. Preview Focus and Code Focus maximize a single
  area; an inspect click inside Preview Focus offers Show Source
  instead of breaking focus. Hidden panes stay mounted so their state
  survives, and native preview bounds track every layout change.
- **Change Project while running** — the new `change_project` command
  stops any live server and analyzes the selected directory as *one*
  operation under a lifecycle mutex that serializes
  analyze/start/stop/restart. The earlier flow (frontend check → stop
  → analyze across three IPCs) could slip a `starting → running`
  transition between the check and the analysis, producing
  `illegal runtime state transition: running -> analyzing`.
- **Snapshot ordering** — `RuntimeState` now carries a monotonic `seq`
  stamped per snapshot; concurrent emit paths (IPC thread vs. process
  watcher) can deliver `rootray://state` out of order, and the reducer
  drops any snapshot older than the last applied — the same guard the
  preview channel already had. Found by installed verification: a late
  `stopped` event was overwriting the `ready` snapshot and leaving the
  UI showing the previous project.
- **Settings** — `openPreviewAutomatically` (default on) migrates the
  legacy `openBrowserAutomatically` value when unset.

#### Installed-app fixes found by golden-path verification (historical)

- **`preview_create` must be `async`** — synchronous commands run inside
  WebView2's IPC dispatch, where `add_child`'s controller creation never
  receives its completion callback (tauri#4121 / wry#583): the app
  deadlocked with all IPC wedged. Async commands run on the runtime, so
  the build posts to the event loop with a clean stack.
- **`.wb-right` width binding** — the inspector pane had `flex-shrink:0`
  with no width, exploded to ~5600px over the workbench and swallowed
  editor clicks; `style={{ width: rightW }}` restored.
- **`stop_dev_server` notify gap** — the in-process static server emits
  no process events, so the stopped transition never reached the UI
  (and `preview_mark_stopped` never fired). `notify_state_changed()` now
  fires on the static-stop and failed-stop paths.
- **Editor flex fit** — `.qe-body`'s fixed 340px overflowed the split
  pane and clipped Save; it now flexes inside `.wb-code`.
- **Stale inspector bundle** — `packages/inspector-runtime/dist` must be
  rebuilt (`pnpm -r build`) before bundling; `build.rs` stages dist
  outputs into `inspector-assets/` automatically.

### Historical — Brand Integration and Open-Source Readiness

> **Partially superseded:** the "purpose-built pixel variants" and the
> asset-pipeline outputs described below were later replaced by
> crops/resizes of the user-approved artwork under
> `docs/brand/source/` — see "Historical — Approved Artwork
> Reconstruction" above for the canonical rule.

The supplied pixel-art robot mascot and identity artwork are now the
product brand — applied to the app shell and docs while the workbench
itself stays a dense, professional developer tool.

- **Asset pipeline** (`scripts/build_brand_assets.py`, Pillow) —
  reproducible: alpha-threshold crop for the standalone mascot, runtime
  lockup/mascot/wordmark under `apps/desktop/public/brand/`, masters
  under `docs/brand/`, multi-size `icon.ico` (16/24/32/48/64/128/256)
  rendered entirely from the robot — purpose-built pixel variants for
  16/24/32px, full mascot from 48px up — plus a 1280×640 social
  preview. (The earlier ring-mark small-icon fallback was rejected and
  removed — see "Superseded — Manual Brand Correction".)
- **Centralized palette** — brand tokens in `index.css`: accent
  `#ff6b0c` sampled from the artwork, ember/glow variables, cool
  blue-gray panel borders. Semantic status tints kept; transient states
  (analyzing/starting/stopping) use the board's info blue.
- **App identity** — bootstrap splash in `index.html` (removed on React
  mount, no artificial delay), mascot header mark + tagline "Point at
  the UI. Reach the source.", branded Home lockup, `BrandLoader` for
  busy states, mascot ErrorBoundary, empty-code-pane watermark,
  Settings → About (version, tagline, stable-release pointer).
- **Docs/community** — rewritten README (hero, real installed-app
  screenshots, honest capability tiers, v0.2/v0.3 distinction),
  `docs/brand.md` brand guide, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, issue forms + PR template.
- **Repo metadata** — description, homepage and 12 topics set via
  GitHub API; Discussions enabled. Social-preview PNG generated at
  `docs/brand/rootray-social-preview.png` — GitHub has no API for it;
  upload is a manual UI step.
- **Real screenshots** — `tests/e2e/installed-shots.mjs` +
  `capture-window.ps1` capture the installed app via `PrintWindow`
  (`PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT`) so the native WebView2 preview surface is
  actually visible (DOM screenshots blank it); DPI-aware sizing fixed
  a clipped right edge on scaled displays.

### Superseded — Manual Brand Correction

> **Superseded** by the Approved Artwork Reconstruction pass: the
> hand-authored small robot maps, the ring-mark references and the
> 3,266,142-byte installer below are historical record, not current
> implementation. Canonical rule: brand assets derive from
> `docs/brand/source/`; current installer is in **Current
> Development**.

Manual feedback on the installed build rejected the previous icon
decision: the Windows title bar and taskbar showed the orange ring
mark, the header mascot was tiny, and the Preview-waiting mascot was
illegible. Correction pass — **the pixel robot mascot is the canonical
RootRay application icon at every size**; the ring mark is decorative
artwork only and no longer appears in any application-icon context.

- **Ring mark rejected** as the primary application icon — removed
  from `icon.ico`, the asset pipeline, and all app-icon surfaces.
- **Dedicated small-size robot variants** — hand-authored pixel maps
  for 16/24/32px (white head, dark face panel, two orange eyes,
  antenna light, ear-ring detail) built with nearest-neighbor output;
  no downscale-blur, no ring fallback. Masters committed under
  `docs/brand/icon-{16,24,32}.png`; `icon.ico` frames verified
  16/24/32/48/64/128/256 — robot at every frame (extracted and
  pixel-inspected).
- **Reproducible pipeline** — `scripts/build_brand_assets.py`
  generates the small variants, `mascot-head.png` (24px canvas), and
  the full icon set; `brand.test.ts` decodes the ICO and asserts robot
  pixel signatures at every frame.
- **Title bar — verified robot** on the real installed build
  (PrintWindow capture: white head + orange eye pixels; no ring).
- **Taskbar — verified robot** on the real installed build. Root
  cause of the lingering ring: the window exposed only `ICON_SMALL`
  (tao sets `ICON_BIG` separately), so Explorer painted its stale
  icon-cache bitmap for the exe path. Fix: the app now sets
  `ICON_SMALL` + `ICON_BIG` from the exe's own icon resource at
  startup (`set_windows_icons` in `lib.rs`); verified via
  `WM_GETICON` — both handles return the robot — plus a targeted
  `SHCNE_UPDATEIMAGE` invalidation and icon-cache rebuild. The
  installed verify locates RootRay's taskbar button via UI Automation
  and asserts robot pixels on that exact tile.
- **Start Menu — verified robot** (shortcut icon extracted:
  white-head + orange pixel signature).
- **Installer / uninstaller / Programs & Features — robot**
  (setup.exe and uninstall.exe icons extracted and pixel-checked;
  `DisplayIcon` resolves to the installed exe).
- **Header sizing** — dedicated robot-head glyph at readable size
  with `Root` (white) / `Ray` (orange) wordmark hierarchy.
- **Loading/waiting sizing** — `BrandLoader` renders the mascot at
  64px (56–80px band); Preview waiting state verified at exactly 64px
  on the installed build; splash keeps the robot lockup at 150px,
  `image-rendering: pixelated`, no artificial delay.
- **DPI** — verified at the machine's 125% scaling (physical-pixel
  captures: crisp title-bar and taskbar icons); the authored per-size

### Historical — Verification and Installer Acceptance

> **Superseded counts/artifacts:** Vitest **191** and Playwright **62**
> below are historical milestones superseded by the current counts in
> **Current Development**. The 3,271,995-byte installer (`31dab9fe…`),
> the 4,162,162-byte candidate (`40B6C2F9…`) and all earlier binaries
> below are superseded — see **Current Development**.

**Acceptance caveat (resolved):** the earlier rounds below ran against a
*manually deployed* binary (the exe copied over the install dir) after
two silent NSIS installs stalled. The final acceptance pass ran the real
installer end-to-end — see "Final installer acceptance".

- Rust **213 green** (200 suite + 13 units, 1 ignored —
  `golden_path_real_vite_server`, passes when run explicitly). New core
  coverage: `change_project` stop-then-analyze under one lifecycle
  hold, `starting`/`running` start notifications, direct-analyze
  rejection while running.
- Vitest **191 green** — exact audit (`pnpm -r test`): desktop **79**,
  inspector-runtime **23**, source-protocol **21**, jsx-instrument
  **20**, intelligence **17**, html-instrument **11**, vite-plugin
  **8**, shared **7**, next-adapter **5**. New coverage: layout
  persistence/clamping/reset, reducer layout actions, stale-snapshot
  drop, preview-controller, brand assets/ICO dimensions/splash removal.
- Playwright **62/62** (workbench + a11y + full regression). New
  coverage: pane collapse/restore, focus modes, output resize, split
  drag, layout persistence, reset, scroll containment, Change Project
  single-command contract, target-switch guard, branded home lockup +
  header mark assertions.
- `pnpm -r typecheck` all 10 projects · `pnpm exec biome check .` clean
  (4 pre-existing CSS warnings) · `cargo check`/`cargo build` both
  crates green.
- **Installed layout + transition verification: PASS**
  (`tests/e2e/installed-verify-layout.mjs` + `pick-folder.ps1`) on the
  NSIS-installed app — real ClientFlow-CRM run with embedded preview:
  Reset Layout, pane hide/restore, output collapse/resize, Preview
  Focus + exit, split drag, inspect→source with hidden inspector,
  restart/stop with no illegal transition, native folder picker driven
  to `fixtures/static-web`, Change Project while running
  (stopped→analyzed→`static-web`, old process tree dead, zero
  notices).

#### Final installer acceptance (real NSIS, no manual copy)

- `pnpm -r build` + `pnpm build:tauri` →
  `target\release\bundle\nsis\RootRay_0.3.0_x64-setup.exe`
  — **3,271,995 bytes** · SHA-256
  `31dab9fe381f99a5183c9ccb10eb9ca9d6ec528a66547bf373ee737d9922cc82`
  (brand build; the earlier 2,952,566-byte binary predates brand
  integration).
- `scripts/installer-smoke.ps1`: **PASS** — silent install → assets →
  launch → no stray dev server → silent uninstall → binary removed.
- **Installed workbench golden path: PASS** on the NSIS-installed app:
  embedded WebView2 preview inside RootRay, every privileged IPC denied
  from the preview, Interact/Inspect, click→exact source, Quick
  Edit→Vite HMR, re-inspect, Escape + Ctrl+Shift+C, toolbar nav, local
  popup policy, preview+server teardown.
- **Installed Next golden path: PASS** — Next 16.2.12, source attrs,
  Fast Refresh round-trip, App Router nav.
- **Installed real projects: PASS** — Shadow Runner (Vite 6.2.0 +
  Phaser; canvas facts/styles, no fabricated source) and ClientFlow-CRM
  (4 elements → 4 exact authored files; git status identical to
  baseline).
- Silent **uninstall verified** — binary, install dir and registry entry
  all removed.
- **Installed brand verification: PASS**
  (`tests/e2e/installed-verify-brand.mjs`) on the NSIS-installed brand
  build — exe icon contains the mascot, branded home (lockup + header
  mark + tagline), Settings → About (version/tagline/stable line),
  then a real ClientFlow-CRM run: embedded preview, inspect →
  `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` source, Preview Focus, clean stop.
- Earlier rounds also passed `installed-golden-static`,
  `installed-golden-monorepo` (workspace-root scoping) on the installed
  app.

## Historical v0.1.x — Patch v0.1.1 (published)

A release-blocking bug was found during first-user testing of the
published v0.1.0 build:

- **Bug:** `Open Project` → pick a valid React + Vite directory → picker
  closes → UI stays on "Open a project".
- **Root cause:** `AppCore::analyze` correctly updated the native
  `RuntimeState` (`analyzing` → `ready`, `project = Some(..)`), but the
  `analyze_project` Tauri command never emitted `rootray://state`, so the
  frontend kept seeing `runtime.project === null`. Same path affected
  `Change…` in ProjectView.
- **Fix:** `AppCore` gained a narrow `set_state_notify` hook (same
  pattern as the existing inspector/editor notifies); `analyze` fires it
  after its synchronous state mutation, and the Tauri shell wires it to
  emit `rootray://state` on both success and failure.
- **Regression tests:** Rust test proves the host notification fires on
  both success and failure with the correct phase/error state; Playwright
  tests prove the stubbed `analyze_project` emit drives HomeView →
  ProjectView and that `Change…` re-analysis updates the view.
- **Audit:** other synchronous state mutations checked — `stop_dev_server`
  state reaches the frontend through the process-event sink; no other
  command had the same missing-emission bug.
- **Installed-app verification: PASS** — the real `0.1.1` NSIS installer
  was installed and the exact reported flow exercised: Open Project →
  native picker → React + Vite fixture → picker closed → ProjectView
  with name, framework, package manager, and dev command.
- **CI:** run `35038504057` on `1beff63` — **success**.
- **Status:** published — `v0.1.0` history preserved below; `v0.1.1` tag
  and GitHub Release are live with the verified Actions artifact.

## Historical v0.1.x — Implemented (Milestone 05 additions)

Everything from Milestones 01–04, plus release hardening:

- **Windows Job Object containment** (`crates/rootray-core/src/process/job.rs`)
  — every spawned dev server is assigned to a RootRay-owned job with
  `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`. Descendants join automatically;
  if RootRay dies unexpectedly, Windows terminates the whole tree. Graceful
  Stop/Restart paths are unchanged. Covered by a real-process integration
  test (`tests/suite/process_containment.rs`).
- **Session recovery** — the last project is re-analyzed on startup
  (read-only; the dev server is *never* auto-started). Settings persist
  recents, preferred editor, browser preference and `lastProject`; a
  deleted project produces a notice, not a crash.
- **React error boundary** (`components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`) — a render
  failure swaps to a compact recovery view (Reload Interface / Copy
  Diagnostics) instead of a blank window.
- **Copy Diagnostics** (`lib/diagnostics.ts` + `get_diagnostics` command)
  — bounded (≤3 KB) report: version, OS/arch, project basename +
  framework/package manager, runner/inspector/editor phases, error codes.
  No tokens, env vars, source, logs or absolute paths.
- **Missing-dependency hint** — an unclean dev-server exit with no
  `node_modules` logs `run "<pm> install"` guidance; RootRay never
  installs silently.
- **Tauri production config** — `productName: RootRay`, identifier
  `dev.rootray.app`, NSIS target, currentUser install (no admin), real
  RootRay icons, publisher/category/description metadata, tight CSP,
  minimum window 820×560, `webviewInstallMode: downloadBootstrapper`
  (official Tauri v2 strategy — silent, skips when present).
- **Bundled inspector assets** — `runner.cjs`/`plugin.cjs`/`runtime.js`
  ship as Tauri resources under `inspector-assets/`; resolution order is
  per-file `ROOTRAY_*_PATH` env overrides → `ROOTRAY_INSPECTOR_ASSETS_DIR`
  (set by the shell to the bundle resource dir) → workspace `packages/`
  fallback for dev.
- **Capabilities trimmed** — `core:default` + `dialog:allow-open` only
  (unused message/ask/confirm permissions removed).
- **Installer smoke script** (`scripts/installer-smoke.ps1`) — silent
  install → file + resource verification → launch → confirms no dev
  server auto-starts → clean terminate → silent uninstall → binary-gone
  check. Prints `INSTALLER SMOKE: PASS`.
- **Release workflow** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) — separate from
  CI; `workflow_dispatch` + `v*` tag triggers; full quality gate → Tauri
  bundle → SHA-256 manifest → installer smoke → artifact upload. Never
  creates a GitHub Release.
- **Accessibility** — visible `:focus-visible` ring, `prefers-reduced-motion`
  honored, palette focus styles; axe pass + keyboard-flow E2E
  (`tests/e2e/a11y.spec.ts`) covering axe serious/critical on both views,
  Ctrl+P / Ctrl+Shift+F flows, explorer keyboard navigation and malformed
  payload resilience.
- **Large-project caps test** — generated 8,300-file corpus proves file
  listing, workspace search and intel collection all truncate at their
  caps instead of walking unbounded.
- **README rewritten for end users** — install, usage, shortcuts,
  supported projects, security/privacy statement, troubleshooting table,
  unsigned-build disclosure.

## Historical v0.1.x — Architecture

Unchanged in shape (see `docs/architecture.md`): rootray-core holds all
logic with zero Tauri deps; the frontend receives events only. New in M5:
`process/job.rs` containment and `ROOTRAY_INSPECTOR_ASSETS_DIR`-based
asset resolution for packaged builds.

## Historical v0.1.0 — Installer

- **Artifact:** `RootRay_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe` (NSIS, per-user install into
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\RootRay` — no admin)
- **Authoritative remote artifact:** GitHub Actions artifact
  `rootray-main-windows-x64` — installer `2,569,430 bytes` (~2.45 MB),
  SHA-256 `01c9840003285c3d98e17077e39f402163d200042f0aba87a8640020a0e6a4ce`,
  matching manifest `RootRay_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe.sha256`.
- **Local build (dev machine):** `target/release/bundle/nsis/RootRay_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe`,
  2,569,034 bytes, SHA-256
  `f41becb1e4e9e3bec4847f49ac325b07bc768e9a840082715aeb9f715d314e4b` —
  differs from the remote artifact (different build machine/time); the
  Actions artifact is authoritative.
- **Unsigned** — SmartScreen/Smart App Control may warn; documented.

## Historical v0.1.x — Verification

> v0.1.x-era counts — superseded. Current v0.2.0 counts are in the
> `v0.2.0 verification` section above (Rust 195 + 1 ignored, Vitest 162,
> Playwright 40).

### Historical v0.1.x automated counts

- `cargo test -p rootray-core`: **129 passed, 0 failed, 1 ignored**
  (+5 vs M4: process containment, large-project caps).
- `cargo test -p rootray-core --test suite -- --ignored`: **golden path
  real-Vite-server test passed**.
- `pnpm -r test` (Vitest): **123 passed**.
- `pnpm --filter @rootray/e2e test` (Playwright, real Chromium): **17
  passed** (+6 a11y/keyboard/resilience spec vs M4).
- `pnpm -r typecheck`: clean. `pnpm exec biome check .`: clean.
- `cargo check -p rootray-core` / `-p rootray-desktop`: clean.
- `cargo build -p rootray-desktop`: clean (debug + release).
- `pnpm --filter @rootray/desktop build`: clean.

### Historical v0.1.0 Release Build

`pnpm build:tauri` → release `rootray-desktop.exe` (10,604,032 bytes,
10.1 MB, local measurement) + the NSIS installer above. The Release
workflow ran the identical command remotely.

### Historical v0.1.0 Installer Smoke Test

- **Local:** `scripts/installer-smoke.ps1` on the locally built artifact —
  silent install OK → exe + all three `inspector-assets` present → app
  launched and initialized (pid verified) → no dev server spawned on
  launch → clean terminate → silent uninstall → binary removed.
  `INSTALLER SMOKE: PASS`.
- **Remote:** the same script ran inside Release run #1 on
  `windows-latest` and passed.

### Historical v0.1.x End-to-End Acceptance

Browser-driven golden path is covered by Playwright against real Vite:
inspect → source → component intelligence → style intelligence →
Quick Edit → safe save → HMR → re-inspect — plus palettes, explorer and
a11y flows against the production-built UI (Tauri internals stubbed for
the DOM-level pass only). Installed-app launch verified by the smoke
script both locally and in Actions. Driving every GUI step inside
WebView2 remains environment-limited (no WebView2 test driver).

### Historical v0.1.x Security Audit

- **IPC/capabilities:** `core:default` + `dialog:allow-open`; commands are
  narrow and re-validate the canonical root on every call.
- **Bridge:** 127.0.0.1-only, dynamic port, ephemeral token; wrong
  token/session/version and malformed messages are rejected — all covered
  by `inspector_bridge` tests (still green).
- **Filesystem/editor:** traversal, `..\`, absolute, symlink escape,
  secrets, binary, oversized, encoding, hash-conflict, external-edit and
  read-only cases covered by `source_edit`/`project_nav` suites (green).
- **Process:** owned trees in a kill-on-close job; unrelated processes
  never touched; nothing killed by port.

### Historical v0.1.x Dependency Audit

- `pnpm audit --prod`: **0 vulnerabilities**.
- `cargo audit` (474 crates): **0 vulnerabilities**; 7 warnings, all
  transitive/unreachable-in-product: `proc-macro-error` + `unic-*`
  unmaintained (build/proc-macro path via Tauri), `glib` iterator
  unsoundness (Linux-only Tauri dep, not called on Windows).
- Secret scan of tracked files: clean — no `.env`, keys, tokens,
  credentials, or machine paths committed.

### Historical v0.1.x Performance (measured, local build)

- Frontend entry: **274 KB JS** (84 KB gzip) + 18 KB CSS — +3 KB vs the
  M4 baseline for diagnostics/boundary code.
- CodeMirror chunk: 321 KB lazy · intelligence/Babel chunk: 313 KB lazy —
  both still off the startup path.
- Inspector runtime payload: 12 KB; runner 5 KB; plugin bundle 601 KB
  (dev-time only).
- Release exe: 10.1 MB · installer: ~2.45 MB.
- 8,300-file synthetic project: listing/search/intel all capped and
  flag `truncated` in ~1 s.
- No startup scan, no idle watcher, no auto-run — by design and by test.

## Historical v0.1.x — Known Issues

- **Unsigned Windows binary** — SmartScreen/Smart App Control may warn
  (documented; signing deferred — no cert provided).
- ~~No LICENSE selected yet~~ — **resolved: MIT**, published with v0.1.0.
- ~~No public `v0.1.0` tag~~ — **resolved: published** at
  `github.com/abudoxali/RootRay/releases/tag/v0.1.0` with the verified
  Actions installer + checksum manifest attached.
- Playwright drives a protocol-faithful mock bridge plus a stubbed-IPC
  DOM pass; the Rust bridge itself is covered by the Rust suite.
- Vite occasionally needs a manual page reload after a broken-then-fixed
  module (E2E documents the fallback).
- Import aliases/deep barrels → `unresolved` by design; matched CSS rules
  navigate to the stylesheet file, not the selector line.
- One Quick Edit session at a time; Unix `stop` kills only the direct
  child (Windows is the target).
- `cargo audit` warnings listed above — unmaintained transitive crates,
  no reachable vuln; tracked upstream via Tauri.

## Historical v0.1.x — Deferred Items

> v0.1.x-era list — partially superseded: v0.2.0's generic-DOM path now
> covers non-React Vite, Vue+Vite, Svelte+Vite, and static sites.
> Current deferrals are in the v0.2.0 "Deferred to later milestones"
> section above.

- Code signing + auto-updater (needs cert + key infra — out of MVP scope).
- GUI-level WebView2 automation; multi-file tabs; selector-line CSS
  resolution; deeper import resolution; non-React frameworks.

## Historical v0.1.0 — Release Artifacts

| Actions artifact | `rootray-main-windows-x64` (Release run #1) | authoritative |
| NSIS installer | `RootRay_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe` | 2,569,430 bytes |
| Checksum manifest | `RootRay_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe.sha256` | matches installer |
| Executable | `target/release/rootray-desktop.exe` | 10.1 MB, local |

## Historical v0.1.0 — Remote Release Verification

- Workflow: `Release` (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
- Trigger: `workflow_dispatch`
- Run: `#1` — Run ID `34982355585`
- Source branch: `main`
- Release source SHA: `eedfee2f0da19665d1089e30b82d76013e3e70c3`
- Conclusion: **success** — every step green: dependency install, lint,
  typecheck, workspace builds, Vitest, Playwright, Rust tests, Tauri
  release build, NSIS packaging, SHA-256 generation, installer smoke
  test, artifact upload.

### GitHub Actions Artifact

- Artifact: `rootray-main-windows-x64`
- Installer: `RootRay_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe` — `2,569,430 bytes`
- SHA-256: `01c9840003285c3d98e17077e39f402163d200042f0aba87a8640020a0e6a4ce`
- Checksum manifest: `RootRay_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe.sha256`
- Manifest checksum verified to match the installer.

## Historical v0.1.0 — Release Source SHA
`eedfee2f0da19665d1089e30b82d76013e3e70c3` — the commit Release run #1
built the v0.1.0 installer from.

## Release Source & Documentation SHAs

- **v0.2.0 release source SHA** (what the release workflow and installer
  were built from): `29b9b6751a12893a027a1db4ed956398946e675b`
- **Post-release documentation SHA** (the v0.2.0 docs-finalization
  commit on `main`): `9a46534eaa78d9d77afe4d172e17097981d6e26b`
- This STATUS-consolidation correction lands as one further
  documentation-only commit on `main`; the installer was NOT built
  from it and the `v0.2.0` tag is unchanged.
