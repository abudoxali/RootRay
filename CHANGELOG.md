# Changelog

All notable changes to RootRay, in [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
style. Dates are UTC. Authoritative detail: [STATUS.md](STATUS.md).

## [Unreleased] — v0.3.0 (development)

### Added — Integrated Browser Workbench

- Embedded WebView2 **Preview** inside RootRay — the project runs in the
  app, not an external browser. Interact/Inspect modes, browser toolbar
  (back/forward/reload/URL/external), loopback-only main-frame navigation;
  remote new-window links open in the system browser. Preview webview has
  zero IPC privileges.
- **Click-to-source in one window** — inspect an element and the mapped
  source opens beside the Preview; edit and save with HMR/Fast Refresh
  or SSE reload applying in place.
- **Flexible workbench layout** — collapsible/resizable Explorer,
  Inspector and Output panes (`Ctrl+B`, `Ctrl+J`), Preview/Code/Split
  views, Preview Focus and Code Focus modes, draggable split with
  double-click reset, persisted layout with clamping, Reset Layout.
- **Brand identity** — RootRay pixel-art mascot/wordmark, new app icon
  pipeline, branded home/splash/states, canonical guide in
  `docs/brand.md`.
- `change_project` command — switching projects while a server runs
  stops the old tree and analyzes under one lifecycle hold.
- `RuntimeState.seq` — monotonic snapshot ordering; the reducer drops
  stale `rootray://state` arrivals.

### Fixed

- `illegal runtime state transition: running -> analyzing` when changing
  projects mid-run — lifecycle commands are now serialized.
- Stale workspace display after project change — out-of-order state
  events could overwrite the newer snapshot.
- Preview bounds/visibility now track every layout change (pane
  collapse, split drag, focus modes, output resize).

### Community

- CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CHANGELOG.md,
  GitHub issue forms and PR template.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09 — Universal Project Workspace
